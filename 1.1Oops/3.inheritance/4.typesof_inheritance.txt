majorly 4 types:

1.simple/single: one class derives from a base class

2.heirarchical: two or more class derived from a single base class

3.multilevel: parent -> child -> grandchild

4.multiple: when a class derives from more than one base class

ambiguity of inheritance:(multiple inheritance)
                    A 
                    |
                ----------
                |         |
                B         C 
                |         |
                 ---- ----
                     |
                     D 
thus if a fun of base class is called in D, the through which path the function will
executed: B or C 

solution: inherit B and C as virtual public of A 
            and D as public of B and C 

class A{
    ......
};

class B:virtual public A{
    ......
};
class C:virtual public A{
    ......
};

class D: public B, public C{
    ......
}
